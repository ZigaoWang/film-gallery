/**
 * A bulk write on somebody's own photos is scoped by owner in the query.
 *
 * The guarantee is that `updateMany({ where: { id: { in: ids }, userId } })`
 * cannot touch a row belonging to another account even when the caller sends
 * an id that is not theirs. It is enforced by the shape of the where clause
 * rather than by a check beforehand, which is the right way round: a check can
 * be skipped for one of the ids, and a scoped write cannot.
 *
 * That makes it invisible to review. Dropping `userId` from the where leaves
 * code that works perfectly for every honest caller and hands every photo on
 * the site to a dishonest one, and no test that exercises the happy path would
 * notice. So this asserts the shape.
 *
 * The admin surface is exempt and listed below, because an administrator
 * acting on any row is the entire point of it, and that surface has its own
 * gate in lib/admin/auth.
