/**
 * The credentials gate, which every other permission on the site stands on.
 *
 * Nothing covered it. That is a poor place to have no test: authorize() is the
 * one function that decides whether a request is anybody at all, and three of
 * the things it does are invisible from the outside.
 *
 * The order of its two refusals is one of them. The password is compared
 * before the verified-email check is reached, so a wrong password on an
 * unconfirmed account answers "wrong password" and not "unconfirmed". Reverse
 * those two and the sign-in form tells a stranger which addresses are
 * registered but never confirmed, without their having to know anything. The
 * pre-flight endpoint that used to answer exactly that question was removed
 * for the same reason, so this test is what stops it coming back by another
 * route.
 *
 * Like revisionPipeline, this needs a database, because what it checks is
 * behavior against real rows. Point DATABASE_URL at a clone, never at
 * production. It creates its own account and removes it again.
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL=<clone> npx tsx scripts/test/authGate.test.ts
