/**
 * Every write to a catalog record goes through the revision pipeline.
 *
 * This is a structural fact rather than a rule anyone will remember. Three write
 * paths existed at one point: the admin table, the suggest-edit form and the
 * owner PATCH routes. Unifying "the" admin path unified one of them, so a
 * reslug added to the pipeline reached none of the others and an approved
 * rename silently left its URL behind. Two more turned up on the next audit: a
 * dead rename endpoint and the bulk edit path.
 *
 * The failure is invisible by construction. A new direct write works perfectly
 * except that it produces no diff, no version bump and no provenance, and
 * nothing notices until something downstream depends on one of those.
 *
 * So this asserts the funnel rather than trusting it. A new direct write to a
 * catalog table fails here and has to be either routed through the pipeline
 * or added to ALLOWED with a reason.
