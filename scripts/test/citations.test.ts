 * Fujifilm 400 is contract manufactured by Kodak, and the source recording that
 * is the Wikipedia article on Superia, because the sentence lives there: the
 * film replaced Superia X-tra 400. The entry was reported as wrong on the
 * strength of the URL alone, and it is not wrong — but nothing on the page let
 * anyone tell, because the passage behind the link was never shown.
 *
 * These cases are the ones that decide whether a reader can judge a citation
 * without opening it.
