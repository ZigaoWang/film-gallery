/**
 * Rewrites catalog prose that is already published, without changing its facts.
 *
 * Distinct from rewrite-pass.ts, which submits *new* research and demands a
 * source URL under every claim. This one exists for the other job: forty-three
 * entries that were each written correctly and none of which were written to
 * match one another. Lengths ran from twelve words to a hundred and thirty,
 * some opened by restating the summary, and a "reviewers report" tic appeared
 * four times in a single paragraph. None of that is a sourcing problem and none
 * of it is fixable by researching harder.
 *
 * Because it introduces no claim, it carries no citation, and the provenance
 * already recorded against these fields keeps applying. That is only true while
 * the rule below holds, so it is the one rule worth stating: an entry here may
 * cut a fact or say it in fewer words, and may not add one. Anything new goes
 * through rewrite-pass.ts with a source under it.
 *
 * Applied as an admin edit, which still writes a Revision and is still
 * reviewable after the fact. Nothing here bypasses the pipeline.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/revoice-pass.ts scripts/rewrite/revoice-films.json [--apply]
 *
 * Without --apply it checks every entry and writes nothing.
