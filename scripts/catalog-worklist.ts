/**
 * Every catalog entry, with what it says now and what is wrong with it, as a

 * research-brief.ts answers a different question: which fields are empty and
 * which claims lack a passage. This one is about the prose. It prints the
 * summary and description in full, because the job is rewriting them and a
 * forty-character preview cannot be rewritten from.
 *
 * The rules at the top are the same four the add and edit forms show, so a
 * batch written from this reads like the entries written through the site.

const RULES = `## How to write these

Four rules. Everything else follows from them.

1. **Open with one sentence saying what it is.** That line is taken as the
   summary and printed above the description, so the description must not
   repeat it. Start the body from the second thing.
2. **Then what the spec chips cannot say.** For a camera: the lens, how it
   focuses and meters, what it is like to carry. For a film: how it looks, how
   it behaves, what it is for.
3. **Skip anything already shown beside it.** Body type, format, year, ISO,
   process and exposures each render as their own chip. Prose that repeats them
   is duplication that goes stale on its own.
4. **Write what is known and stop.** No "iconic", no "legendary", no "the best",
   no "the only". A claim about everything else ever made is almost always
   wrong. If a maker says something, say that they say it.

Aim for 40 to 150 words. There is no minimum worth padding to: four true
sentences beat eight with two guesses in them.

### An entry that follows them

> A 1993 zoom compact with a 38 to 115mm lens, sold as the Sure Shot Z115 in the
> Americas.
>
> The lens is ten elements in nine groups, one of them aspherical, and opens to
> f/3.6 at the wide end. It focuses to 0.6m.
>
> At 350g on two CR123A cells it is a lot of camera to carry for a compact. The
> long end is dim: f/8.5 at 115mm, so you are on flash or fast film well before
> you get there.
