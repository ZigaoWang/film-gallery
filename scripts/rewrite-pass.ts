 * the thing this catalog exists not to be, just in better prose.
 *
 * Content lives in scripts/rewrite/*.json, one file per batch. Each entry
 * carries the fields it proposes and a source URL per field. A field with no
 * source is not submitted, which is enforced here and again by a CHECK on the
 * table for anything model-sourced.
