/**
 * The guidelines, in the site's own voice.
 *
 * These briefly lived as Part Three of the legal document, which was the wrong
 * home twice over: it put the interesting part behind a liability clause, and
 * it left two pages stating the content rules in different words. The terms
 * now reference this page, so there is one set of rules and this is it.
 *
 * Shares its type scale and column width with /legal so moving between the two
 * doesn't feel like moving between two sites.
