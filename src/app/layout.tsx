 * The three families the site draws with. Each is exposed only as a CSS
 * variable; globals.css maps those onto Tailwind's `--font-sans`,
 * `--font-display` and `--font-mono` so the utility classes resolve to them.
 *
 * `display: 'swap'` on all three: the fallback renders immediately and is
 * replaced when the file arrives, rather than holding the text invisible.
 *
 * Bebas Neue used to be loaded here as well. Nothing referenced it — not a
 * class, not a variable, not a CSS rule — so it was a font file fetched on
 * every cold visit and never drawn.

          tab through the whole header — logo, five nav links, search, sign in —
          before reaching the content, on every single navigation.

          It targets each page's own <main>, which every page now carries the
          id on. It used to target a wrapper around {children} here, on the
          theory that one id in one place could not be forgotten — but every
          page renders its own <Header /> inside that wrapper, so the target
          sat *above* the header and moving focus to it skipped nothing at all.
          The next Tab landed on the logo, and then on the nine header controls
          the link exists to bypass.
