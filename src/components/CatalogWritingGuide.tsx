/**
 * How to write a catalog entry, next to the box it is written in.
 *
 * docs/writing-standard.md is the full answer and runs to several hundred
 * lines, which is right for somebody curating the catalog and useless to
 * somebody adding the camera they just shot a roll on. Nobody opens a style
 * guide before filling in a form. So this is the short version, in the one
 * place it can still change what gets typed.
 *
 * The rules here are the four from that document that actually decide whether
 * an entry reads like the rest of the catalog. Everything else in it is either
 * a curator's concern or follows from these.
 *
 * The example is a real entry rather than an invented one, so what it shows is
 * reachable rather than aspirational.
