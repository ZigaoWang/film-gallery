/**
 * The frame around every sign-in, join and password form.
 *
 * The photographs are the argument; everything else is in the way of it. This
 * screen had accumulated three separate pitches — a subtitle under the
 * heading, a sentence laid over the collage, and a row of counted totals — and
 * three separate places to navigate from: a back link and the wordmark at the
 * top, and a strip of section links under the form. For a page whose whole job
 * is four boxes and a button, that is more furniture than form.
 *
 * What is left: the wordmark, the heading, one line saying what the page is
 * for, the form, and the photographs. No copy over the collage and no
 * gradient across it — the photographs are the argument, so nothing is
 * painted on top of them.
 *
 * The form comes first in the DOM. The collage is decorative and marked as
 * such, so a screen reader lands on the heading rather than walking a dozen
 * unlabelled images to reach it.

          to the left edge. It left two thirds of the screen empty beside the

            The height is fixed and the columns are fed twelve frames, which
            overflows it even on a 375px screen holding nothing but panoramas —
            checked, because an under-filled band is the notch again. Letting the packing decide
            the height instead left the three columns ending at three different
            heights, which on six photographs is not a contact sheet, it is a
            black notch in the corner.

            The fade is what makes the cut deliberate. A hard edge across the
            middle of a photograph reads as a bug; a fade into the page reads
            as more of them below.

            Aligned to the form's own measure, so its edges line up with the
