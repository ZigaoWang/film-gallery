 * px-3 py-2), border (neutral-700 or neutral-800), background (neutral-800,
 * -900 or -950), corner radius, and whether focus drew a ring. Which one you
 * got depended on which page you were on.
 *
 * Square corners rather than the rounded-sm variant: the site's cards, chips

 * gives no way to check what landed in it: the cost of a typo is a failed
 * sign-in on an existing account, and on the sign-up form it is an account
 * whose password nobody knows, discovered at the next sign-in.
 *
 * Built here rather than on one form, because a reveal on Register and not on
 * Reset is worse than none: the two would then behave differently for the same
 * job, which is the thing this codebase's shared primitives exist to stop.
 *
 * The control is a real button, so it is reachable by keyboard and announced,
 * and `aria-pressed` says which state it is in. It is deliberately outside the
 * tab order's way of the submit button only in the sense that it comes after
 * the field it belongs to, which is where somebody checking their typing
 * expects to find it. The field starts hidden every time; nothing remembers
 * that it was revealed.
