 * Form controls. One look for every input, textarea and select on the site.

 * px-3 py-2), border (neutral-700 or neutral-800), background (neutral-800,
 * -900 or -950), corner radius, and whether focus drew a ring. Which one you
 * got depended on which page you were on.
 *
 * Square corners rather than the rounded-sm variant: the site's cards, chips
 * and buttons are all square, and the rounded inputs were one modal's local
 * habit rather than a decision.
