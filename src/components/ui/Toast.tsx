        Every outcome on this site is reported here and nowhere else: a comment
        posted, a photo that would not delete, a rate limit. None of it was
        announced. A screen reader user pressed Post and was told nothing,
        either way.

        Two regions, because the two urgencies differ. A failure interrupts —
        the thing the reader asked for did not happen. A confirmation waits its
        turn. Both wrappers stay mounted whether or not they hold anything: a
        live region inserted at the same moment as its content is not reliably
        announced, because the screen reader was not already watching it.

        The stack itself ignores pointer events and each message takes them
        back, so an empty container cannot sit over the corner of the page
        swallowing clicks.
