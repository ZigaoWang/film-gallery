 * different hearts — an outlined SVG on the grid, the characters ♡ and ♥ on
 * the photo page, which render at whatever weight the reader's emoji font
 * feels like — and both discarded the response, so a like that the server
 * refused (rate limited, signed out in another tab, photo deleted) stayed
 * filled in on screen and was gone on the next load.
