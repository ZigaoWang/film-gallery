/**
 * The label above a form control. One component for every form on the site.
 *
 * There were eight different label styles and three different ways of marking
 * a field required — "(required)" in grey, a bare "*", and nothing at all
 * beyond the HTML attribute. This is the single answer: sentence case, and a
 * red asterisk for required, which is what a reader already knows how to read.
 *
 * The asterisk is decorative, so it is hidden from assistive technology and
 * the word "required" is announced instead. The control itself should still
 * carry `required` — this only communicates the requirement visually.
