/**
 * A film stock or a camera, as a card that links to its page.
 *
 * The photo page drew this twice, inline and once per kind, differing only in
 * the icon and the label. The combination page then grew a third copy with its
 * own panel, its own image size and its own hover colour, which is exactly the
 * second card component four pixels off the first that makes a site feel
 * unfinished.
 *
 * One card, both kinds, everywhere the pair is shown.
 *
 * The chips are derived here rather than passed in. They used to be a `specs`
 * prop, and every page filled it differently: the pairing page gave four facts
 * per side, the photo page gave a film its ISO and a camera nothing at all, so
 * the two cards under a photograph did not match each other. A shared component
 * whose contents are decided by its callers is not shared in the way that
 * matters. Taking the prop away is what makes them agree, so it is gone rather
 * than defaulted.

          Two constraints pulling against each other, and the indent is what
          satisfies both. The chips cannot go *inside* the name's column: that
          left them about 270px, four did not fit, and the last one wrapped
          alone under the other three with the rest of the card empty beside
          it. But a full-bleed row starts under the picture, so its left edge
          did not line up with anything and the card read as two unrelated
          blocks stacked up. Their own row, pushed right by exactly the
          picture's width plus the gap (w-20 + gap-4 = 6rem), so they begin
          where the name begins and still have the rest of the card to wrap
          into. Only from sm up: on a phone the 6rem is worth more as chip
          width than as alignment. */}
