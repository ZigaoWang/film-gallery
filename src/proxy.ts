/**
 * Permanent redirects to the URL an entry currently lives at.
 *
 * This has to happen here rather than in the page: calling permanentRedirect()
 * inside a streaming Server Component is too late to set an HTTP status, so
 * Next falls back to a client-side redirect. Google treats a real 308 far more
 * decisively, and these URLs are already in the index.
 *
 * Two things reach here. A legacy cuid, which is what this was built for, and a
 * slug an entry used to live at before it was renamed. The second was handled
 * only by the page, which meant it got the same weak client-side redirect for
 * the same reason, and renaming is no longer rare: the suggest-edit form offers
 * it, and every rename retires a slug that is already linked to and indexed.
 *
 * A retired slug costs one indexed point lookup on (kind, slug), which is the
 * table's primary key. A cuid is recognised by shape and never reaches it.
 *
 * Proxy always runs on the Node.js runtime (so Prisma is available) and must
 * not declare a `runtime` config — doing so is a build error. The matcher keeps
 * this off every other route.
