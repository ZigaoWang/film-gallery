 * transaction that creates it, so it costs no extra step, but it still leaves a
 * diff, a history and provenance rows behind.
 *
 * Applying is deliberately one transaction: the entity write, the provenance
 * rows and the version bump land together or not at all. Provenance written
 * afterwards by a caller is provenance that goes missing the first time
 * something throws, which is how the previous admin path came to have none.
