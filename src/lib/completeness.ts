/**
 * How complete a catalog entry is, and how much of it anybody has checked.
 *
 * Two separate questions, deliberately kept apart. A page with every field
 * filled and nothing cited is not the same as one with half the fields filled
 * and all of them sourced, and collapsing the two into one percentage would
 * make the first look better than the second. It is the second this catalog
 * is trying to be.
 *
 * ## The computation
 *
 * Fields are weighted, because they are not equally worth having. A film's
 * process changes what a reader can do with it; its product code does not.
 * Three tiers:
 *
 *   - **core**: the entry is not usable without it
 *   - **useful**: what someone came to the page for
 *   - **extra**: worth having, nobody misses it
 *
 * `filled` is the share of weight that has a value. `cited` is the share of
 * *filled* weight carrying a source. Cited is expressed against what is filled
 * rather than against everything, because an unfilled field is not an uncited
 * claim: it is honestly absent, and counting it as a citation failure would
 * punish leaving a gap open, which is the behavior the catalog wants.
 *
 * Legacy columns are excluded. They are superseded and scheduled for removal,
 * and counting them would make every entry look permanently incomplete.
