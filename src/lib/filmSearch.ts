 * Film stock helpers that run in the browser.

 * on Prisma reaching it puts the whole client in the browser bundle. The query
 * itself lives in catalogueSearch, which is server only, and nothing in this
 * file may grow a second copy of it.
 *
 * Film stock lookup, alternate names included.
 *
 * A stock is known by more than its stored name: Kodak Vision3 500T is "5219"
 * to anyone buying it in 35mm, and Kentmere Pan 400 is often written "Kentmere
 * 400". Those live in the `aliases` array, and searching has to cover them or
 * the stock is simply unfindable by the name people actually use.

/**
 * A film stock as the pickers need it.
 *
 * Six files declared their own version of this and only some included
 * aliases, which is why the picker on one page could find "5219" and the
 * picker on another could not.
