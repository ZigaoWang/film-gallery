/**
 * A citation, reduced to what a reader needs to judge it.
 *
 * A bare link is not enough. Fujifilm 400 is contract manufactured by Kodak and
 * the source that says so is the Wikipedia article on Superia, because that is
 * where the sentence lives — the film replaced Superia X-tra 400. A reader
 * shown "Kodak (reported)" linking to a page called "Fujifilm Superia" has no
 * way to tell a correct citation from a careless one without opening it and
 * reading, and the one that looks wrong here happens to be right.
 *
 * So the passage travels with the link. `claims` already records the words each
 * citation stands behind, for detecting when an edit moves out from under one;
 * the same text answers "does this source say that" at a glance.
 *
 * Pure, and importing nothing that reaches the database, because the admin
 * table renders these in a client component.

 * that moves out from under a citation can be detected. `passage` holds the
 * sentence in *the source*, so a reader can see the source says it. Quoting
 * `claim` as though it came from the source would show the site our own prose
