 * album, a photographer's gear — needs "the first four photos of each of these
 * fifty things". Prisma cannot express that: a nested `take` on a to-many
 * relation is applied *in memory*, and the SQL it emits carries no LIMIT at
 * all. Asking for four photos of fifty cameras fetched every photo of all
 * fifty, every column, and threw away all but two hundred rows.
 *
 * The database does it in one pass with a window function. This module is the
 * one place that query lives; it was hand-copied into five pages, each with
 * its own slightly different visibility rules.
