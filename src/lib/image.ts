 * A HEIC/HEIF buffer as a PNG, refusing anything too large to hold.

 * This runs before the first `sharp()` call, so the pixel ceiling that
 * protects every other path does not apply to it. Left unbounded, libheif
 * allocated `width * height * 4` bytes for any dimensions the file declared
 * and the process was one crafted upload away from being killed on a 2GB box.
 *
 * `all()` reads each frame's dimensions out of the container without decoding
 * it, which is what makes the check possible: the size is known before
 * anything is allocated, so an oversized file costs a header parse rather than
 * the memory it was asking for.
 *
 * The encode goes through sharp rather than heic-convert's, which is pngjs
 * writing at deflate level 9 — synchronous, and long enough on a large raster
 * to stall every other request on this single-process server.
