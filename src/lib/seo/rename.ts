/**
 * Renaming a film stock or camera, keeping its old URLs working.
 *
 * The slug is derived from the name, so a rename moves the page. Three things
 * have to happen together for that not to break the site:
 *
 *   1. The new slug has to be unique, because the column is.
 *   2. The slug it replaces has to be recorded, or every link to the old URL
 *      404s — the resolver matches slugs exactly and nothing else would know
 *      where the page went.
 *   3. If the record is renamed *back*, the slug it is returning to has to stop
 *      being a redirect, or the page would bounce to itself forever.
 *
 * All three run in one transaction: a slug written without its history entry is
 * a broken link, and a history entry without the slug is a redirect loop.
