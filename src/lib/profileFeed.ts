 * midnight the count and its label disagreed. Counting server-side gives every
 * viewer the same answer, and the day filter uses the same boundaries so
 * clicking a square returns exactly the photos it counted.
 *
 * createdAt is `timestamp without time zone` holding UTC, so it is truncated
 * as-is. Writing `AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` converts it to timestamptz, after which
 * date_trunc works in the *database session's* timezone — on a server set to
 * Asia/Shanghai that moved every photo eight hours, so squares were counted
 * against one day and the filter queried another.
