 * The photographs shown beside the sign-in and join forms.

 * The auth pages were a logo and a form on an empty black page — the one part
 * of the site that shows none of what the site is for, at the moment somebody
 * is deciding whether to bother. This puts real frames from the archive next
 * to the form, which is both the honest argument for joining and the one that
 * needs no copy.
 *
 * It used to carry three totals as well, for a row of counted figures under
 * the collage. The figures were a second pitch on a page that only has to ask
 * for an email address, so they and their three count queries are gone.

 * The showcase is pinned to the full height of the screen, and the columns are
 * packed at each photograph's own aspect ratio, so the total height depends on
 * what got drawn. Twelve left black space under the collage beside the sign-up
 * form, which is the tallest of the four.
