/**
 * How a film's manufacturer reads to someone who has never thought about it.
 *
 * The name on the box is often not the company that coated the film, and that
 * is the single most useful thing this catalog knows. Saying it plainly is
 * the whole point: telling a reader Fujifilm 400 is made by Kodak is a
 * different claim from telling them it is widely reported to be, and the second
 * one is the honest version.
 *
 * The qualifier carries that distinction, so it is deliberately a plain word.
 * "Reported" is what a person would say. "Attributed" is the schema's word and
 * means nothing to a reader.
 *
 * Importing nothing but a type, so the same wording is available to a server
 * page, a client picker and the admin table. Four places rendering this four
 * ways is how a catalog starts contradicting itself.
