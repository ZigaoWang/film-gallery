/**
 * Matching a catalog record by its name or by a name it is also sold under.
 *
 * Both halves of the catalog have the same problem. A film stock is "5219" to
 * anyone buying Vision3 500T in 35mm, and a camera body sold as the Mju in one
 * market is the Stylus in another. A record stored under one name is simply
 * unfindable to everyone who knows it by the other.
 *
 * One function rather than one per entity, because two implementations of the
 * same search drift and the drift is invisible: the symptom is a record that
 * one page can find and another cannot, which is exactly what happened when
 * aliases were matched with array containment in some callers and not others.
 *
 * Aliases go through raw SQL because Prisma cannot express a case-insensitive
 * comparison inside an array column. `hasSome` is exact containment, so "5219"
 * matched but "vision" never matched "VISION3 500T". Unnesting and comparing
 * with ILIKE makes an alias behave like any other searchable text.
